A project called "space invaders", based on the well-known retro game "Space invaders". Written mostly on JavaScript.
The player is controlled via the a & d buttons, for moving to the left and right respectively.
The player can fire a laser on the push of a space button.
The player has three lives, and with each batch of monsters cleared, the next one becomes faster.
